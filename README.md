## Used datasets
To evaluate the quality of embeddings generated by CLEORA we combine two datasets, which consist of citation network of scientific papers:<br>
### Iteseer

The dataset consists of 3312 publications categorized into classes and described be a keywords vector. For our task we consider keyword vector and category as metadata, so we only care about table of 4732  citation links between papers
### CORA

This dataset has similar structure as the previous one, but the graph is denser with only 2708 publications and 5429 links (edges)
