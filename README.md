Semantic Web and Social Networks Final Project at @PUT Poznan:
KG Embeddings: exploring **Cleora**: A Simple, Strong and Scalable Graph Embedding Scheme.

### Case study
we take on the role of a recruiter aiming to identify top talent for machine learning engineer positions. Our goal is to focus on active and engaged users, specifically those with at least 10 starred repositories, as these individuals will likely be better candidates. Since the dataset we are using, GitHub Social Network [1], was created in June 2019, these developers likely now have even more experience and expertise. <br></br>
For node embeddings, we will use Cleora [2]embeddings, which capture structural information by embedding relationships among nodes.
